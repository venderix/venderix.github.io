        <p>This afternoon, I woke up to the distant sound of an explosion. Next thing I know, I'm looking outside my window and hearing police sirens. Turns out that something happened at Winsow High School. Honestly not that surprising considering the reputation that place has.</p>
        <p>Anyone know the details? Was it a caster?</p>

        <p>Yeah that place has been a powder keg for months. I’m honestly surprised it didn’t blow up sooner.</p>

        <p>Apparently a locker in Winsow exploded during lunch. They found a bunch of nasty garbage and bugs all over the debris (how on earth did THAT get in a locker?). Blast was big enough to punch a hole through the ceiling.</p>
